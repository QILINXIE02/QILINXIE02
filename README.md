I like creating useful websites and mobile applications. Before software development, my background was in Education.  I love tutoring, and teaching students symbolic logic. I realized not only how much I appreicate logic myself but also enjoy sharing that understanding with others, especially when I use software tools to demonstrate concepts. 
 
I actively look for opportunities to connect with others in the field. Being Fluent in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, and intermediate in Spanish, I bring a multicultural perspective to every project in tech. In my personal life, I like spending times outdoor.
