Hi there world 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m Qilin Xie, a full stack JS developer based in Portland, OR area.
- 🌱 I completed my certification in Advanced Software Development as part of the Code Fellows full-stack software development program.
- 👀 I’m passionate in leveraging tech for impactful solutions such as bridging the connection of education and technology by hosting a coding program.

- 📫 How to reach me: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qilinxie/)

I like creating useful websites and mobile applications. Before software development, my background was in Education.  I love tutoring, and teaching students symbolic logic. I realized not only how much I appreicate logic myself but also enjoy sharing that understanding with others, especially when I use software tools to demonstrate concepts. 

My portfolio on GitHub reflects my dedication to constantly learning and improvement as a developer. I am always on the lookout for new projects that will push me out of my comfort zone and help me grow my skills.

I actively look for opportunities to connect with others in the field. Being Fluent in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, and intermediate in Spanish, I bring a multicultural perspective to every project in tech. In my personal life, I like spending times outdoor.

Thank you for visiting! Feel free to look around a leave a comment on a project!
