 I spend free time creating websites! I also like times outdoor, walking and hiking. Before learning software development my background was in Education.  I love tutoring, and teching students. I realized not only how much I understand logic myself but also enjoy showing others that understanding with others, especially when I use software tools to demonstrate concepts.
 
I actively look for opportunities to connect with others in the field. Being Fluent in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, and intermediate in Spanish, I bring a multicultural perspective to every project in tech.

Thank you for visiting! Feel free to look around a leave a comment on a project!
